    <h2>What are semantic elements?</h2>
    <p>Semantic elements help provide additional information to web browsers and developers about the roles and importance of different parts of the web page. Using semantic elements makes the code easier to read, both to browsers and developers. It also leads to more consistent code.</p>

    <h3>Consistent Code</h3>
    <p>Consistent code is important because there's many different ways to create certain elements. Sticking with one consistent way, such as using a <em>header</em> tag vs <em>div class="header"</em>, makes it easier for everyone.</p>
